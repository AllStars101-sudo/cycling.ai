# Cycling.ai - Comprehensive Sustainable Transit Planner powered by Generative AI

## Preface

Cycling.ai was created for the BuildClub Hackathon 2024 by Chris Pagolu and Xianyu Cai.

## Overview

Cycling.ai is a dynamic multi-platform application designed to provide cyclists with detailed route planning and health analysis. Leveraging the power of AI technologies including Google‚Äôs Gemini Flash, OpenAI, Supabase, and Sahha AI for health insights, the application offers a feature-rich experience for users who are deeply invested in their cycling activities.

## Features

### Web Application

1. **Authentication**
   - Users can log in and log out using Auth0, ensuring secure access to personalized features.

2. **Route Calculation**
   - Calculate cycling routes, along with real-time data on distance, average elevation, estimated calories burned, and traffic and roadwork information using various API integrations like Google Maps, OpenWeatherMap, and Bing Maps.

3. **AI-Generated Insights**
   - Using Google Gemini Flash, generate AI-driven insights about cycling routes focusing on health benefits (with data fed using Sahha API), elevation considerations, weather, traffic conditions, and fun facts.

4. **Popular Spots**
   - Display popular cycling spots around the user's location with short summaries generated using Google Gemini Flash and images generated using OpenAI's DALL-E 2.

5. **QR Code Integration**
   - Generate a QR code for user data, which can be scanned and linked with an iPhone app for additional health data integration.

6. **Trip History**
   - View past trips, with historical data stored and retrieved from Supabase.

7. **AI-Generated Images**
   - Utilize OpenAI to generate images of the planned routes for better visualization.

### iPhone App

1. **QR Code Scanner**
   - Scan QR codes generated by the web app to link the user‚Äôs iPhone to their Cycling.ai account, enabling the integration of Sahha AI for further health insights.

2. **Demographics**
   - Users can input and update their demographic information.

3. **Sensor Management**
   - Enable or disable sensors for health monitoring and link health data with Supabase.

4. **Health Analysis**
   - Obtain daily and weekly health analysis using Sahha AI and store this data in Supabase.

5. **WebView Integration**
   - View additional insights through web views embedded within the app.

The iPhone app is also open source and available [here](https://github.com/AllStars101-sudo/cycling.ai-ios). It is not available on the App Store or on TestFlight currently.
